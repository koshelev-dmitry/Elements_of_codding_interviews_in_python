"""
There are a number of points in the plane that you want to observe.
You are located at the point (0,0).
You can rotate about this point, and your field of view is fixed angle.
What is the maximum number of visible points?

Example:
angles = [0,30,45,60,150,220,300]
fov_angle = 90
output: 4 
explanation: the maximum number of points is 4 because 0,30,45,60 are
all inside of fov_angle
